## Requirements

- Microsoft Edge, and Chrome browser
- YouTube videos must have closed captions/subtitles available
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) installed for AI summarization features

## Ollama Setup

For the AI summarization features to work, Ollama needs to be running with CORS enabled. Follow these platform-specific instructions:

### Linux/macOS

1. Start Ollama with CORS enabled:
```bash
OLLAMA_ORIGINS=* ollama serve
```

2. To make it permanent, add to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*
```
Then restart your terminal or run:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

### Windows

1. Using PowerShell, set the environment variable and start Ollama:
```powershell
$env:OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*"
ollama serve
```

2. To make it permanent (PowerShell as Administrator):
```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('OLLAMA_ORIGINS', '*', [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
```
Then restart PowerShell.

### Docker

Run Ollama in a Docker container with CORS enabled:
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name ollama \
  -v ollama:/root/.ollama \
  -p 11434:11434 \
  -e OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*" \
  ollama/ollama
```

### Verifying the Setup

1. After starting Ollama, verify it's running by visiting:
```
http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

2. You should see a JSON response listing available models.

### Troubleshooting Ollama

If the extension can't connect to Ollama:

1. Verify Ollama is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

2. Check if CORS is enabled:
   - Look for the OLLAMA_ORIGINS environment variable
   - Restart Ollama after changing environment variables
   - Check your firewall settings

3. Common issues:
   - "Failed to fetch" error: Ollama not running or CORS not enabled
   - "Model not found": Run `ollama pull modelname` first
   - Connection refused: Port 11434 blocked by firewall

### Security Note

Setting `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*` allows requests from any origin. For production use:
- Limit OLLAMA_ORIGINS to specific trusted domains
- Consider implementing additional security measures
- Only use * for development/testing purposes
